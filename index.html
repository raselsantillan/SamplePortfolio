            <h4>Background on Information Technology:</h4>
            <p>
                Being a student, my knowledge of Information Technology starts with something like exploring a giant library, but I've already tackled some exciting sections! I'm comfortable with the basics—using computers, doing research online, and creating presentations for school. This strong foundation has launched me into <b>Software Development</b>—the brains behind the programs we use. I've also explored <b>Networking</b>, the invisible web that connects everything, and even gotten my hands dirty with <b>Computer Hardware</b>, the physical building blocks of our machines. It seems like IT offers a never-ending journey, and I'm excited to keep learning and creating in this vast and fascinating world!
